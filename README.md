# Authentication and Authorization in ASP.NET Core Blazor
Starter files &amp; fully functioning finished sample code for my Authentication and Authorization in ASP.NET Core Blazor course, currently targeting .NET 8.

The main branch exactly matches the course. The latest-and-greatest branch contains changes that were incorporated after recording. Most often these changes are language features that are relatively new and/or in preview, like primary constructors, switch expressions and so on. Most of these changes will probably make it into the main branch when course updates happen, but if you don't want to wait for that you can already check it out - enjoy :-)
